    <h3>Painting and Sculpture</h3>
    <p>For centuries, <strong>Paris</strong> has attracted artists from around the world, who arrive in the city to educate themselves and to seek inspiration from its vast pool of artistic resources and galleries. As a result, <strong>Paris</strong> has acquired a reputation as the <strong>"City of Art"</strong>. Painting and sculpture became the pride of the French monarchy and the French royal family commissioned many Parisian artists to adorn their palaces during <em>the French Baroque and Classicism era</em>. Sculptors such as <strong><em>Girardon, Coysevox and Coustou</em></strong> acquired reputations as the finest artists in the royal court in <strong class='number'>17</strong>th-century <strong>France</strong>. <strong><em>Pierre Mignard</em></strong> became the first painter to <strong><em>King Louis XIV</em></strong> during this period. 
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Paris</strong> was in its artistic prime in the <strong class='number'>19</strong>th century and early <strong class='number'>20</strong>th century, when it had a colony of artists established in the city and in art schools associated with some of the finest painters of the times: <strong><em>Édouard Manet, Claude Monet, Berthe Morisot, Paul Gauguin, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Vincent van Gogh, Paul Cézanne, Jean Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Henri Rousseau, Marc Chagall, Amedeo Modigliani</em></strong> and others.
    </P>
    <p>
    The most prestigious names of <strong>French</strong> and foreign sculptors, who made their reputation in <strong>Paris</strong> in the modern era, are <strong><em>Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi (Statue of Liberty – Liberty Enlightening the World), Auguste Rodin, Camille Claudel, Antoine Bourdelle, Paul Landowski (statue of Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro) and Aristide Maillol</em></strong>. 
    </p>
        
        <h3>Photography</h3>
    <p>
        The inventor <strong><em>Nicéphore Niépce</em></strong> produced the <em>first permanent photograph</em> on a polished pewter plate in <strong>Paris</strong> in <strong class='number'>1825</strong>. In <strong class='number'>1839</strong>, after the death of <strong><em>Niépce, Louis Daguerre</em></strong> patented the <em>Daguerrotype</em>, which became the most common form of photography until the <strong class='number'>1860</strong>s. The work of <strong><em>Étienne-Jules Marey</em></strong> in the <strong class='number'>1880</strong>s contributed considerably to the development of modern photography.
        </p>
        <p>
        Photography came to occupy a central role in <em>Parisian Surrealist activity</em>, in the works of <strong><em>Man Ray and Maurice Tabard</em></strong>. Numerous photographers achieved renown for their photography of <strong>Paris</strong>, including <strong><em>Eugène Atget</em></strong>, noted for his depictions of street scenes, <strong><em>Robert Doisneau</em></strong>, noted for his playful pictures of people and market scenes (among which <strong><em>Le baiser de l'hôtel de ville</em></strong> has become iconic of the romantic vision of <strong>Paris</strong>), <strong><em>Marcel Bovis</em></strong>, noted for his night scenes, as well as others such as <strong><em>Jacques-Henri Lartigue and Henri Cartier-Bresson</em></strong>. 
        </p>
        <p>
        <em>Poster art</em> also became an important art form in <strong>Paris</strong> in the late nineteenth century, through the work of <strong><em>Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Jules Chéret, Eugène Grasset, Adolphe Willette, Pierre Bonnard, Georges de Feure, Henri-Gabriel Ibels, Paul Gavarni and Alphonse Mucha</em></strong>.
